## How do you use the scripts?

Simply [download the script](src/main.py)!

Please modify the variables called "user_id" and "webhook" to the user ID of the player you want to track along with a Discord webhook. There's also a variable called "minutes_per_check" which is the amount of minutes between a check. You can modify it if you want.

All you need is Python. I wrote this in Python 3.10.6, so I'd recommend you [install that version](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/). However, later versions should work too.
